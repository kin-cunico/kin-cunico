# Hello, my name is Kin 🏳️‍🌈, born in Brazil 🇧🇷, raised in Italy 🇮🇹. 
<p>You can contact me by sending an email to contact@kincunico.dev </p>
<p>
Currently, I am based in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, but eager to move anywhere 🌐 given a fitting opportunity. <br>
As far as technologies go, I am proficient with JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python. 
I love playing video games 🎮 and board games 🎲, travelling 🛩️, drawing 🖼️, and writing ✍️. <br>
Devising something egregious is where you will most likely find me.

<i>But just bear with me, I have this idea...</i>
