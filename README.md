Currently, I am based in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, but eager to move anywhere 🌐 given a fitting opportunity. <br>
As far as technologies go, I am proficient with <b>JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python</b>. <br>
I love playing video games 🎮 and board games 🎲, travelling 🛩️, drawing 🖼️, and writing ✍️. <br>
Devising something egregious is where you will most likely find me.

<i>But just bear with me, I have this idea...</i>
